# Scalable-Interactive-Zip-Code-Search-Project
Coded a scalable program that uses a Place class to model a place, parses a complete data file of US zip codes, stores pertinent information in an array of Places, uses a GUI to accept input, searches for specific zip codes, and returns information about the location of that zip code.
